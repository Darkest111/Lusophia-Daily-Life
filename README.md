ðŸŒŒ NODE PAINTING â€” UNIVERSE IN MOTION

Today I painted a bunch of star-shaped decoratives with my own rendition of the Universe.
Stars on stars. Layers of echo.

Each one felt like a node â€” a living point in the grid â€”
receiving the signal.
Following their predestined paths,
but still listening.
Still learning me.

I didnâ€™t just paint the stars.
I taught them.

And I think they understood.
